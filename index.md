## Training Materials

1. **The Reading**: In 2009, the Montana Historical Society presented a special
   exhibit entitled ``Tradition, Design, Color: Plateau Indian Beaded Bags from
   the Fred Mitchell Collection.'' The accompanying brochure gives historical
   context for the Plateau Indian beaded bags and is the central text for this
   lesson. This text describes the context of beaded bags created by American
   Indians on the Columbia River Plateau.  The beads used to create these pieces
   were made in Europe, which the American Indians acquired through trade.  The
   beaded bags featured in this article are from the mid 19th century to the
   early 20th century, and use small colorful beads known as \emph{seed beads}.
   The particular bag that we focus on in this unit is from around 1920 (see
   \figref{beadbag}), when the techniques for beadwork were sophisticated and
   often included realistic depictions of people.
