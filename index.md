# The Storytelling Project: Teacher Trainings

Welcome to the teacher professional devleopment for the Storytelling
project.  This page provides materials for the teacher trainings.

The next training is: Tuesday, 26 July 2022, at the Montana STEM Summer Institute.  If you aren't registerd and would like to attend, please email us <storytelling@montana.edu> to let us know you are interested!

<!--
## Before the PD Event:

We look forward to seeing you on 3/30 for the Storytelling professional
development training.  Prior to the event, you will need to do the following:

1. Take the [pre-survey](TODO).
2. Download [Alice 2](https://www.alice.org/get-alice/alice-2/).  Be sure to
   dowload Alice 2, not Alice 3!  We suggest saving this to your desktop, so it
   is easy to find on Monday.
   If you are unable to use your personal
   computer for this purpose, please contact us via email
   <storytelling@montana.edu> and we will give you access to a virtual machine
   that you can access through a web browser.
3. Download starter world. Download the Alice "starter world" we will be using
   for our lesson. Follow [this link](./assets/beaded-bag-starter.a2w) to download.
4. This webpage contains materials needed for the training.
   Please bookmark this link, and feel free to take a look prior to 3/30!

## Training Materials

1. **The Reading**: In 2009, the Montana Historical Society presented a special
   exhibit entitled "Tradition, Design, Color: Plateau Indian Beaded Bags from
   the Fred Mitchell Collection." The accompanying brochure gives historical
   context for the Plateau Indian beaded bags and is the central text for this
   lesson. This text describes the context of beaded bags created by American
   Indians on the Columbia River Plateau.  The beads used to create these pieces
   were made in Europe, which the American Indians acquired through trade.

2. Content Standards and Lesson Objectives
    * **Compute Science Standards** CS.AP.6-8.4 from [Montana CS Content Standards](https://opi.mt.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=VUuz382OEeQ%3d&portalid=182): Algorithms and Programming: Decompose problem into parts.
    * **Essential Understandings** EU 6: History from Indian Perspectives
    * **Additional Content Standards** Art Anchor Standard 11 from [Montana Arts Content Standards](https://opi.mt.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=2v0S2hRBPjs%3d&portalid=182): distinguish different ways that artworks represent, establish, reinforce, and reflect group
identity.
3. Miro boards: During this training, you will use Miro, an online whiteboard,
   to work on a concept map and as a place you can fill out worksheets and take
   notes.  You will be assigned a board and a password during the training.

4. The [Beaded Bag Lesson Plan](./assets/beaded-bag.pdf). This visual arts unit
   is designed to help students understand the history of beaded bags and their
   connection to the tribes of the Columbia Plateau, and to introduce students
   to computational thinking.  We have selected one such bag from the Fred
   Mitchell Collection, and center class discussions
   around interpretations of what the scene depicts (and why).  Using the
   historical context, students are asked to imagine what happens next in this
   scene, and to animate the scenario they create using Alice. The following
   worksheets accompany this LP:
    * [Worksheet 1](./assets/worksheet1.pdf). In this worksheet, students'
      understanding of the anchor text, read before class period one, will be
      assessed.  Students will respond to questions about their personal
      knowledge of beaded art, American Indian tribes from the Columbia River
      Plateau, the history of beaded bags, and their personal experiences with
      computer animation.
    * [Worksheet 2](./assets/worksheet2.pdf). In this worksheet, students'
      understanding of class period one will be assessed. Students will reflect
      on their impressions of beaded bag artwork, make a connection between
      history and storytelling, describe the story that they plan on animating
      in Alice, and plan the sequence of actions that will take place in their
      animation.
   * [Worksheet 3](./assets/worksheet3.pdf). In this worksheet, students'
     understanding of class period two will be assessed. Students will reflect
     on their experience with animation, make a connection between coding and
     other contexts, and reflect on their knowledge of different coding methods.
5. Rubric: In order to help you assess Alice worlds created by your students in
   this lesson, we have created The Storytelling Rubric that can be tuned to
   specific objectives in three areas: Computer Science, IEFA, and other content
   standards.
